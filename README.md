### Making Changes to the App

1. Edit code within the repository
1. Commit the change to the `main` branch. Normally it's a better practice to create a new branch for your change and then merge that branch to `main` after review, but for this demo you can commit to the `main` branch directly.
1. Visit https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps and navigate to your sample app.
1. You should see a "Building..." progress indicator, just like when you first created the app.
1. Once the build completes successfully, click the **Live App** link in the header and you should see your updated application running. You may need to force refresh the page in your browser (e.g. using **Shift+Reload**).
